# What to do in the Hague?

A full-stack application which collects together all the programs for bored people in (and around) the Hague.
Stack I'm planning to use: 
- back-end (Python): FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQL database 
- front-end (Typescript/Javascript): Next.js

This project is in development phase.
